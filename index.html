         Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites, ranging from simple static pages to complex dynamic applications. 
        It involves a combination of programming, design, and problem-solving skills to build functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing online experiences. 
        Web development is typically divided into three main areas: front-end development, which focuses on the design and user interface; back-end development, which handles server-side logic and databases; and full-stack development, which combines both. 
        With the ever-growing use of the internet, web development has become an essential skill in the digital age.

            Frontend development focuses on creating the visual and interactive parts of a website that users see and interact with directly. 
            A frontend developer works to ensure that a website is responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing across all devices. 
            Modern frontend development often includes frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue to build dynamic and efficient user interfaces. 
            The goal is to deliver an engaging experience that connects design with functionality.

            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. 
            It defines the layout of a webpage using various elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. 
            HTML uses tags and attributes to organize information, ensuring browsers can display it correctly. 
            While HTML provides the structure, it works alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, making it an essential foundation for building modern, functional, and visually appealing websites.

            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to design and enhance the appearance of webpages created with HTML. 
            It controls how elements such as text, images, and layouts are displayed, allowing developers to set colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. By separating content (HTML) from design (CSS), it makes websites easier to maintain and more visually appealing. 
            CSS can be applied inline, internally within the HTML file, or externally through linked style sheets, enabling consistent styling across multiple pages.

           JavaScript is a versatile programming language used to add interactivity, functionality, and dynamic behavior to websites. 
           It enables developers to create features such as animations, form validations, interactive maps, and real-time updates without reloading the page. Working alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript forms the core of modern web development, allowing for rich user experiences. 
           It can be run directly in the browser for client-side scripting or on servers using environments like Node.js, making it one of the most important and widely used technologies in the web world.
